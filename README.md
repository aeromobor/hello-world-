My name is Andrew Eromobor

I am 1 of the members of Group 1 Project for ABC company where we created a master data by first starting with a conceptual model and then designing the model and uploading it into SQL. We also created Tables, inserts and views for our Master data. We tested out the views and created queries lastly we created deadlocks.
